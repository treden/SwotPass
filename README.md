# SwotPass

Simple, fast tools to list past/future SWOT overpasses over an area of interest and co-locate them with in-situ observations — using theoretical (nominal) satellite ephemerides.

Originally developed by Clémence Chupin under the PyGoat toolbox (C. Chupin, Y-T. Tranchant, L. Testut, V. Ballu, 2021) and extracted/adapted to SWOT as an independent module (YTT, 2025).
